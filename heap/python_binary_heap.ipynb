    "A Binary Heap is a Binary Tree with following properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It’s a complete tree (All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible). This property of Binary Heap makes them suitable to be stored in an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A Binary Heap is either Min Heap or Max Heap. In a Min Binary Heap, the key at root must be minimum among all keys present in Binary Heap. The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree. Max Binary Heap is similar to MinHeap.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. `getMini()`: It returns the root element of Min Heap. Time Complexity of this operation is _O(1)_.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `extractMin()`: Removes the minimum element from MinHeap. Time Complexity of this Operation is _O(Log n)_ as this operation needs to maintain the heap property (by calling `heapify()`) after removing root.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `decreaseKey()`: Decreases value of key. The time complexity of this operation is _O(Log n)_. If the decreases key value of a node is greater than the parent of the node, then we don’t need to do anything. Otherwise, we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `insert()`: Inserting a new key takes _O(Log n)_ time. We add a new key at the end of the tree. If new key is greater than its parent, then we don’t need to do anything. Otherwise, we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `delete()`: Deleting a key also takes _O(Log n)_ time. We replace the key to be deleted with minum infinite by calling `decreaseKey()`. After `decreaseKey()`, the minus infinite value must reach root, so we call `extractMin()` to remove the key.\n",
    "\n",
