You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n","\n","\n","#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n","\n","To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python.

For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbours and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbour B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, the current value will be kept.\n","4. When we are done considering all of the unvisited neighbours of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will never be checked again.\n","5. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\n","6. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \"current node\", and go back to step 3."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":24,"id":"certain-today","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["def update_distances(graph, current, distance, parent=None):\n","    \"\"\"Update the distances of the current node's neighbors\"\"\"\n","    neighbors = graph.data[current]\n","    weights = graph.weight[current]\n","    for i, node in enumerate(neighbors):\n","        weight = weights[i]\n","        if distance[current] + weight < distance[node]:\n","            distance[node] = distance[current] + weight\n","            if parent:\n","                parent[node] = current\n","\n","def pick_next_node(distance, visited):\n","    \"\"\"Pick the next univisited node at the smallest distance\"\"\"\n","    min_distance = float('inf')\n","    min_node = None\n","    for node in range(len(distance)):\n","        if not visited[node] and distance[node] < min_distance:\n","            min_node = node\n","            min_distance = distance[node]\n","    return min_node"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"apparent-decrease","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"spare-glossary","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"id":"adopted-creek","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["(6, 7)"]},"execution_count":25,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["num_nodes7 = 6\n","edges7 = [(0, 1, 4), (0, 2, 2), (1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 10), (2, 4, 3), (4, 3, 4), (3, 5, 11)]\n","num_nodes7, len(edges7)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"spatial-engagement","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"specific-champagne","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"right-kenya","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"foreign-malpractice","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import jovian"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"reserved-investor","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["jovian.commit()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"coordinate-circle","metadata":{},"source":["### Binary Heap\n","\n","A data structure to maintain the running minimum/maximum of a set of numbers, supporting efficient addition/removal.\n","\n","\n","<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ABAcM7m.png\" width=\"400\">\n","\n","\n","Heap operations:\n","\n","- Insertion - $O(log N)$\n","- Min/Max - $O(1)$ (depending on type of heap)\n","- Deletion - $O(log N)$\n","- Convert a list to a heap - $O(n)$\n","\n","\n","Python's built-in heap: https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html\n","\n","> **Question**: Implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm using the `heap` module from Python.
