You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n","\n","\n","#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n","\n","To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n","\n",">  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This notebook is made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"eligible-kuwait","metadata":{},"source":["## Problem\n","\n","In this notebook, we'll focus our discussion on the following problem:\n","\n","> **QUESTION**: Write a function to reverse a linked list\n","\n","Before we answer this question, we need to answer:\n","\n","- What do we mean by linked list? \n","- How do we create a linked list in Python?\n","- How do we store numbers in a linked list?\n","- How do we retrieve numbers in a linked list\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"resident-weather","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["%pip install jovian --upgrade --quiet"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"quantitative-dream","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import jovian"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"available-humor","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["jovian.commit()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"prime-lucas","metadata":{},"source":["## Linked List\n","\n","A linked list is a _data structure_ used for storing a sequence of elements.
